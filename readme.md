# Ignition
Something like a base-theme.

## What is Ignition?
There are a lot of good base-themes for Drupal. This isn't one of them. This is highly customized to my own needs. I'll remove a lot of the markup I remove in every projecr anyhow. It' set with parts of the HTML5 Boilerplate, Semantic.gs some things that are inspired by 320 and up, some of my own ideas and a Compass setup.
